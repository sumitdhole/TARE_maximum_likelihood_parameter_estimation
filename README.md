This repository includes Mathematica and R versions of maximum likelihood parameter estimation code for a TARE-based Tethered Homing drive experiment. The R and Mathematica versions are largely redundant, except that the Mathematica version includes additional model variations and figures of 95% confidence intervals with more thorough annotation.

The '.nb' Mathematica file is best displayed in Wolfram Mathematica. A free version of Wolfram Player for reading .nb files (without execution ability) is available through the Wolfram website - https://www.wolfram.com/player/?source=nav.

The file is annotated with explanations for each code block. Execution of the file in Mathematica should not require any additional dependencies. Note that Producing some of the 3D graphics may take several minutes on less powerful machines.
